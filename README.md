# DC-MBAR data
The testing system include the intramolecular proton transfer reaction of the glycine and the Diels-Alder reactions between cyclopentadiene and acrylonitrile in explicit solvent. The simulation details could be found in our previous studies. The reaction coordinates sampled by Umbrella Sampling are stored in the data folder.
